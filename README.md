# Workforce-Absenteeism-Analysis-

![Absenteeism](https://github.com/ANURUDRA-JENA/Web-Scraping-Project-2/blob/ab40acd8291a6ed1cf7fc9dda6430491f8e5f38e/asset_management/proj6.png)

This analysis was made for one of my freelance clients. This aims to analyze to the absenteeism of employees in the workforce.
Sadly the original source of data couldn't be shared due to confidentiality policies, but a doctored version of the original data
source was made with the 'EmpID- Employee Name' & 'Workforce callout number' column being replaced with random names and numbers.

Further in this analysis, various reasons for Employee's call-outs were tried to be determined.
Only the relevant Callout reasons were kept for analysis and several valuable insights were generated.
Please make sure to checkout the ipynb file for the complete analysis.

Thanks in advance
